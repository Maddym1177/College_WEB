        <h5>WILLINGDON COLLEGE, SANGLI <br> ESTABLISHMENT : YEAR 1920</h5>

        <p>In order to meet the growing demand of higher education in the Southern Maratha Country and North Karnataka
            Region, the Deccan Education Society decided to start a College in the year 1919. His Excellency Lord
            Willingdon, the then Governor of Bombay, was approached and his support was taken in order to seek the
            recognition of the scheme from the then British Government. In appreciation of His Excellency Lord
            Willingdon's interest and timely help, it was decided to name the college after him. The Rulers of
            Southern Maratha Princely States were approached for financial help, which was sought generously.
            The Honourable Members of the Society selected the neighbourhood of the Sangli and Miraj as suitable site
            for the College as it lay on the border of Maharashtra and Karnataka. The college was affiliated to the
            Bombay University in the beginning.The College was started on the morning of 22 June 1919 in the Sangli
            City in the building where Rani Saraswati Kanya Shala stands today. At the beginning only the Arts wing
            was started with an enrollment of 220 students.Later on Wrangler R.P.Paranjapye and the founder Principal
            of the College Shri.C.G.Bhatye with great effort,secured an area of 125 acres (0.51 km2) at Vishrambag for
            the college and the work of construction was immediately taken up.</p>
